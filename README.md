## Used technologies

- Angular
- Bootstrap
- Tensorflow
- Angular Material

## How to run

It is an Angular application. Restore npm packages and run the development server. Don't worry about the error in the console saying: `Source has 4 element(s) but target allows only 3`. Just navigate to an app in the browser.
